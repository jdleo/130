to compile and run the main program in a command-line interface:
first navigate to the project 2 directory -->
cd path/to/directory/Project2

lastly, just compile and run -->
javac *.java
java project2


to test the performance of AVL trees vs. BST trees, you will
need to use the project2performance.java file provided
first navigate to the project 2 directory -->
cd path/to/directory/Project2

lastly, just compile and run (this program takes an ARGUMENT) -->
javac *.java
java project2performance N

(N must be an integer. Don't use anything too large or the JVM
will run out of heap space. I tested up to N=30,000,000 without 
issues before I had to manually increase my heap/stack size)
